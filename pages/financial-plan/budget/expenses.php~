                    <h3>List your company's expenses</h3>
                    <p>Get started on your budget by adding your projected expenses below. Some common expenses are already included. Feel free to remove or rename them if they do not apply to your situation. Expenses like these are all tax deductible and will affect your profits. Be sure not to add any major purchases with long-lasting value here. (We will deal with those later, since they are not immediately tax deductible.) If your company is just getting started, be sure to include any one-time or short-term startup expenses in the early months as you get up and running.</p>
