		Your mission statement is meant to be a simple, internal message for you and your employees: 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; •	What is the core value and purpose of the company? <br/>
&nbsp; •	What is the vision, which will guide company decisions, now and in the future? <br/>
<br/>
Think of it as the rally cry for you and your employees; this is the reason why you do what you do, every day. All other goals should support this mission.
