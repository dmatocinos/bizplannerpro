			The successful execution of your business plan is likely to depend on a handful of key events. </p>
<ul>
<li>	When will the new product you are developing start generating revenue? </li>
<li>	How quickly can you recruit the right marketing team to generate new leads?</li>
<li>	How long will it take to source and relocate to new offices?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, identify the 'milestone events' that are strategically important for your business, and make your best guesstimate when you will achieve them. This is not a detailed task list of everything your business needs to do. Instead, include only those key events that represent important assumptions affecting the rest of your plan.</p> 
<br/>
<p>You should review and update your milestones regularly. When key events are completed early or slip to a later date, this is a good time to review and revise your plan to ensure that it is still achievable.</p>
<br/>
<strong>Establishing Milestones</strong>
<p>If your goal is to get your business started, then a milestone is the date to complete a task which brings you closer to your goal. Track the important tasks; don't try to create a detailed 'to-do' list. </p>
<ul>
<li>	Set a date and a budget (if necessary) for each milestone. </li>
<li>	Explain what's involved,</li> 
<li>	Who is responsible</li>
<li>	When it should happen. </li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you keep track of your progress, and keep your goal in sight.
