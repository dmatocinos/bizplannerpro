			The small business owner will often neglect to establish an effective marketing strategy believing their product or service will sell itself. However it is one of the most important factors for any business to succeed. You can have the best product in the world, but if you can't find customers or importantly they can't find you, your business will fail.
Fortunately, marketing is mostly common sense. It's about answering basic questions about your business:<br/><br/>
&nbsp; •	Who has a need for your product/service?  <br/>
&nbsp; •	Who are your competitors and how do you compare? <br/> 
&nbsp; •	How much will you charge? <br/>
&nbsp; •	How will you promote your products?<br/> 
&nbsp; •	Will you sell directly or through third parties? <br/>

<br/><br/>
<strong>Overview</strong><br/>
A marketing plan should broadly outline three things: <br/>
&nbsp; •	How you differentiate your business from your competitors;<br/> 
&nbsp; •	How you will communicate that difference<br/>
&nbsp; •	How you target your message to the right audience. <br/>
A marketing plan is about generating qualified leads. Your sales plan will address how you close the sales.
