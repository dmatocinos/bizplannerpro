<li>	The steps you follow to close a sale.</li>
<li>	How you reward your sales team; do they receive a commission for each sale?</li>
<li>	How the company processes and tracks the order once it's received.</li>
<li> 	How you keep in contact with your customers throughout the sales process.</li> 
<li>	Where and how do you store customer information?</li>
<li>	What is the final step in your sales process?</li>
