			Preparing a SWOT analysis is a relatively simple task. The acronym stands for 'Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.' The idea behind this exercise is for you to focus on and describe your company's strategic position in these four areas. </p>
<ul>
<li>	What are the greatest strengths and weaknesses of your company? </li>
<li>	Where do you see your most promising opportunities? </li>
<li>	What competitive threats do you need to avoid or overcome to take advantage of those opportunities?</li>
</ul>
