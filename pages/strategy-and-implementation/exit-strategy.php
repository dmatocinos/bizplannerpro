			When preparing your business plan an aspect that should be defined is your exit strategy. This is particularly important if you are looking for outside investment into your business. Investors before trusting you with their money, will want to know how they will get their money back - and will they make a healthy profit. 

Two exit strategies are common;</p>
<ul>
<li>One is acquisition, if your company does well, larger players in your industry may want to buy it rather than try to compete with it. </li>
<li>A second common exit strategy is going public, taking your company onto a public stock market so its shares of stock can legally be bought and sold.</li>
</ul>
