		If someone asks you who is your client/customer?<br/><br/>
		&nbsp; •	How do you answer them? <br/>
		&nbsp; •	How much do you know about the people you want to sell to? <br/>
		&nbsp; •	Where can you find this information?<br/><br/>
		
		Start by asking yourself what need your product or service fills for your clients/customers. 
		Then think about how (or where) your customers find you, how they buy from you? <br/><br/>
		
		As you answer these questions, you will start to see a similar need - location, price point, quality level, 
		and prestige - or other common reason they choose to do business with you. <br/><br/>
		
		&nbsp; •	Do your products appeal to a certain age group? <br/>
		&nbsp; •	Do you sell more to men, or more to women? Why? <br/><br/>
		
		Based on shared reasons or traits, you can divide them into groups and define your core target market.<br/><br/>
		
		You also want to show what's going on with this market (growth, trends), and how your business fits into the larger 
		industry that meets this market's needs.
