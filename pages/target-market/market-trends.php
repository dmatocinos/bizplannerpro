		Nothing in life stands still, as the saying goes 'The only constant is change.' Having a business is a perfect way to see change in action. 
		Just when you think you have identified your core market, it changes. What you think your clients/customers want or need changes. 
		There's a shift in direction.
		<br /><br />
		Change happens for many different reasons. No matter the reason, it is important to be able to recognise when a change can or 
		will affect your business. You should look for, and be aware of, market trends. Think of trends as a way to get ahead of the 
		market and understand where it is going before it gets there.
