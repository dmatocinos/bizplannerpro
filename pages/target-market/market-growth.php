		An important factor for any business is to understand its market and how it is developing.<br/><br/>
		&nbsp; •	Has it changed, where is the market for your business going? <br/>
		&nbsp; •	Is it moving in a different direction from where it has been? <br/>
		&nbsp; •	How can you use your strengths to take advantage of this growth?<br/><br/>
		
		Be able to confirm sustained market growth can enhance the implied value of your business. It is therefore important to find
		 data which supports your market estimates. This is particularly important if you are presenting your business plan to
		  secure for outside funding. Look to market research firms, trade associations, or credible journalists, and include their
		   findings here. The Internet is a great place to research for this type of content.
